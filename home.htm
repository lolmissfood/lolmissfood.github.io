            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, is a highly contagious viral infection primarily affecting birds but with the potential to infect humans in certain circumstances. This website provides an in-depth look at the virus, its effects, and the global efforts to control it.</p>

                <h3>Understanding Avian Influenza Viruses</h3>
                <p>Bird flu is caused by influenza viruses such as H5N1, H7N9, and others. These viruses infect birds, spreading through saliva, secretions, and droppings. Their ability to mutate and occasionally cross species barriers poses challenges for containment and treatment.</p>

                <h3>Patterns of Bird Flu Outbreaks</h3>
                <p>Outbreaks of bird flu often correlate with bird migration seasons. High-risk regions are typically those with dense poultry farming and close contact between humans and birds, such as parts of Asia and Africa. Monitoring these patterns is critical for prevention.</p>
